# Phase 83 — AI-Engineering Job-Description Mapping

## Recruiter-ready positioning

- Built a production-grade Agentic AI platform using Python, TypeScript, OpenAI integration, RAG, LangGraph-style durable orchestration, MCP-governed tools, multimodal evidence processing, and event-driven APIs.
- Implemented measurable RAG, agent, safety, multimodal, security, and release-candidate evaluation gates; claims in this document point to the exact code and verification artifacts.
- Designed cloud-native deployment and operational controls with Kubernetes/Helm, Kafka, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, object storage, OIDC, guardrails, auditability, and observability.

## Claiming policy

Do not convert CI-enforced or environment-limited evidence into a claim of local execution. In particular, the LangGraph package runtime remains optional in this execution container; the graph architecture, state/reducer contracts, checkpoint behavior, and orchestration checkpoint are implemented and tested through the repository’s deterministic runtime boundaries.
