# Phase 52 Handoff — 500-Case Evaluation Dataset

Phase 52 is complete and cumulative through Phase 52.

## Delivered

- `evals/datasets/verideploy-500/v1.jsonl`: exactly 500 deterministic synthetic evaluation cases.
- `evals/datasets/verideploy-500/manifest.json`: version, SHA-256, category counts, and quality-gate evidence.
- Seven required categories: retrieval (100), RCA (80), release risk (80), visual (60), document QA (60), hallucination (60), citation (60).
- Explicit ground truth and source requirements on every Phase 52 case.
- Fail-closed dataset quality checks for counts, categories, semantic duplicates, leakage, label contracts, source contracts, split, and provenance.
- Deterministic regeneration script and CI validation command.
- Focused Phase 52 test coverage plus the cumulative regression suite.

## Verification

- Phase 52 dataset gate: passed, 500 cases, 500 unique case IDs, 500 unique semantic fingerprints, zero issues.
- Phase 51 + Phase 52 focused evaluation tests: 10 passed.
- Full cumulative Python suite: 557 passed, 20 skipped, 0 failed.
- Python bytecode compilation: passed.
- Deterministic regeneration comparison: passed byte-for-byte for the JSONL corpus.
- Ruff/MyPy binaries were not installed in this execution container; CI retains both checks via `uv sync --all-groups`.

## Phase 53

Next: Retrieval Metrics — Recall@1/5/10, MRR, NDCG, metadata-filter correctness, latency, retriever/fusion comparisons, and repeated-run variance or confidence intervals.
