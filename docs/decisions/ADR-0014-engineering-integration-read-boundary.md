# ADR-0014 — Engineering Integration Read Boundary

## Status
Accepted in Phase 26.

## Decision
External engineering systems are accessed through explicit read-only adapters behind a shared outbound policy. The adapter layer owns endpoint allowlisting, credentials, pagination, retries, quotas, and provider response normalization. Agent and MCP layers may request an authorized operation but may not supply credentials, arbitrary hosts, or generic URLs.

Unconfigured and failed integrations are first-class states. They must not be converted into an empty successful result because doing so changes workflow truth.

## Consequences
- Phase 25 GitHub MCP reads inherit Phase 26 host/retry/quota/secret controls.
- Provider-specific pagination remains inside adapters.
- Outbound write APIs remain outside Phase 26.
- Synthetic data implements the same result contract but is clearly labeled and cannot masquerade as live data.
