# Phase 2 Verification

Phase 2 was verified with the executable checks available in the build environment.

## Passed

- `pytest`: 12 tests passed, covering policy scoring, human-review thresholds, idempotent durable persistence, private status authorization, and Kafka-worker handler behavior.
- Python byte compilation.
- OpenAPI and AsyncAPI semantic-version checks.
- JSON parsing for versioned release-risk command/event schemas.
- YAML parsing for OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Docker Compose.
- TypeScript/TSX syntax transpilation for all new Phase 2 gateway and frontend files.
- Phase 2 placeholder scan.
- secret-pattern scan.

## Blocked by the execution environment

Docker is not installed, so the real Compose topology cannot be launched here. Node dependencies are also not installed and external package registries are unavailable, so dependency-aware NestJS/Next.js builds, tests, linting, and type checking cannot be truthfully reported as passing. These checks remain CI/local-environment gates and are not fabricated.

## Phase 2 data path

The production contract is `Next.js -> NestJS -> Kafka -> Python worker -> persistence -> private status API -> NestJS -> Next.js`. The web UI reconciles queued state by polling the authoritative tenant-scoped status resource. WebSocket/SSE live event streaming belongs to Phase 3.
