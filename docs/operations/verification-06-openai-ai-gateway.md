# Phase 6 verification

## Acceptance criteria

- provider-neutral AI gateway exists;
- OpenAI production adapter exists behind the gateway;
- timeouts and bounded retry classification are explicit;
- rate/budget admission controls exist and production requires distributed state;
- request/correlation/provider IDs are traceable;
- secrets are redacted and status output is sanitized;
- default tests make no paid API calls;
- failures are typed and retryable/non-retryable behavior is deterministic.

## Executed in artifact environment

The final artifact records the exact executable results in `artifacts/verification-06-openai-ai-gateway.txt`.

## Environment limitations

The artifact environment does not provide Docker Engine or a provisioned pnpm workspace with downloadable npm dependencies. Therefore Docker/Redis/OpenAI live integration, full Next.js/NestJS dependency-aware build, and package-manager audit are not represented as passed checks. No live OpenAI request was made, by design.
