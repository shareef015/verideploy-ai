# Phase 10 Verification

## Executed in this environment

- cumulative Python tests;
- focused structured-output tests;
- Python compilation;
- generated JSON Schema validation;
- structured-output manifest validation;
- deterministic TypeScript contract generation comparison;
- OpenAI adapter structured `text.format` mapping test;
- placeholder and secret-pattern source scans;
- ZIP integrity verification.

## Environment limitations

This execution environment may not contain Docker Engine or a fully provisioned pnpm workspace, so live container startup and dependency-aware Next.js/NestJS builds are not claimed unless their tools are present and executed. No live OpenAI request is required by the default Phase 10 suite.
