# Phase 8 Verification

Phase 8 acceptance criteria:

1. typed OpenAI Responses API inputs and function tools;
2. streaming and non-streaming execution terminating in the same typed `AIResult` contract;
3. explicit cancellation support;
4. extended usage extraction and provider request/response IDs;
5. tenant-scoped normalized response persistence and retrieval;
6. normalized error mapping with Retry-After support;
7. streaming retries/fallbacks prohibited after visible output;
8. trusted private execute/stream/retrieve/cancel service endpoints;
9. mocked HTTP contract verification and no paid API calls in the default suite.

## Build-environment result

The cumulative Python suite passed **73 tests**, including **12 Phase 8-focused tests**: 9 adapter/stream/persistence tests, 1 mocked-HTTP Responses contract test, and 2 private-service endpoint tests. Python compilation, cumulative contract/config parsing, FastAPI live/ready/AI-status smoke, private SSE streaming smoke, 35-file TypeScript/TSX syntax transpilation, placeholder scanning, and secret-pattern scanning passed.

No live OpenAI request was made. The environment does not provide a usable installed OpenAI SDK distribution, Docker Engine, pnpm, Ruff, or MyPy, so those live/dependency-aware checks are not reported as passed. The project declares the official `openai` Python SDK dependency and tests the adapter through injected SDK-compatible clients plus an `httpx.MockTransport` HTTP contract.
