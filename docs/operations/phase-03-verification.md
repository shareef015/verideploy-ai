# Phase 3 verification

## Executed in the build environment

- Full Python test suite: executed.
- Focused investigation repository, worker, API, replay, cancellation, idempotency, and tenant isolation tests: executed.
- Python byte compilation: executed.
- OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON contract semantic validation: executed.
- TypeScript/TSX syntax transpilation: executed using the installed TypeScript compiler API without dependency resolution.
- YAML/JSON parsing and Docker Compose structural validation: executed.
- Secret-pattern and TODO/FIXME scans: executed.
- Archive integrity and SHA-256 generation: executed.

## Environment limitations

This environment does not contain the repository `node_modules` and cannot access external package registries, so dependency-aware Next.js/NestJS builds, lint, Jest/Vitest, and full TypeScript semantic checks cannot be truthfully executed here. Docker Engine is also unavailable, so the Kafka/PostgreSQL/SSE Compose path cannot be launched end to end inside this runtime.

These are environment limitations, not reported passes. Run `make setup`, `make up`, `make test`, `make lint`, and `make typecheck` on a networked development machine with Docker Engine to exercise those gates.
