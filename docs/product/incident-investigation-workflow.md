# Phase 3 — Real-Time Incident Investigation Workflow

Phase 3 establishes the durable control plane for incident investigations. It intentionally does not fabricate RCA, evidence retrieval, LangGraph planning, or agent reasoning that belong to later phases.

## Public flow

1. The Next.js incident page sends `POST /api/v1/investigations` to NestJS with tenant, user, correlation, and idempotency headers.
2. NestJS derives a stable investigation UUID and publishes `verideploy.commands.investigation.v1` with `acks=-1`.
3. The Python investigation worker validates the Pydantic command, creates tenant-scoped durable state, and appends ordered events in the same persistence boundary.
4. Each durable event is published on `verideploy.events.investigation.v1` using the canonical event envelope.
5. NestJS consumes live Kafka events and fans them out over authenticated-header SSE.
6. On initial connection or reconnect, the gateway first replays events after `Last-Event-ID` from the authoritative Python service and then follows the live Kafka stream.
7. The browser reconciles live progress with `GET /api/v1/investigations/{id}`; frontend event state is never authoritative.

## Durable ordering

Each investigation owns a monotonic `sequence_number`. Persistence rejects skipped, duplicate, or out-of-order sequence insertion. Replays use `after_sequence`, making event delivery at-least-once while UI application is idempotent by `event_id`.

## Cancellation

`POST /api/v1/investigations/{id}/cancel` publishes a versioned cancellation command. The worker records `CANCELLING`, persists the reason, emits the transition, then records the terminal `CANCELLED` state and event. Repeated cancellation of a terminal investigation is safe.

## Phase boundary

A successful Phase 3 create initializes a real durable investigation runtime and leaves it `RUNNING`. Evidence ingestion, specialist execution, RCA, critic loops, and completed investigation reports are not simulated here; those capabilities are introduced by their assigned later phases.
