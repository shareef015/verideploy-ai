# Phase 44 — Next.js Production Frontend Foundation

## Purpose

Phase 44 replaces the cumulative page-by-page frontend with a production App Router foundation while preserving the public URLs established in earlier phases. All product routes live under the `(platform)` route group and inherit one authenticated server layout, one session context, one TanStack Query client, one gateway-only browser client, and one accessible application shell.

## Security and routing boundary

The browser remains constrained to the Phase 43 NestJS BFF. `gatewayFetch()` accepts only `/api/v1/*` paths and rejects gateway origins containing `/internal/v1` or port `8000`. No product page owns a gateway origin, tenant UUID, user UUID, or raw `fetch()` call.

The authenticated layout verifies the `verideploy_session` cookie on the server with HMAC-SHA256 and constant-time signature comparison. The payload contains tenant ID, user ID, roles, display name and expiry. Missing, invalid or expired sessions redirect to `/sign-in`. `FRONTEND_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` is permitted only outside `NODE_ENV=production` and defaults to false.

## App Router structure

```text
app/
  layout.tsx
  global-error.tsx
  sign-in/page.tsx
  (platform)/
    layout.tsx
    loading.tsx
    error.tsx
    not-found.tsx
    page.tsx
    release-risk/
    incidents/
    evidence/
    postmortems/
    approvals/
    topology/
    evidence-graph/
    citations/[citationId]/
```

Route groups do not alter URLs, so `/approvals` and `/topology` remain stable while becoming protected by the platform layout.

## Data and realtime foundation

TanStack Query owns server-state caching for read-heavy screens. Zod schemas validate gateway responses before UI rendering. Mutating/streaming workflows use the same session-aware gateway client. Dedicated SSE and WebSocket clients are gateway-scoped and reject private-AI origins.

## Design system

Phase 44 adds CSS design tokens, Tailwind v4 configuration, shadcn-compatible `components.json`, and reusable `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, and `StatePanel` primitives. The overview uses Tailwind responsive grid breakpoints; cumulative workflow-specific styles remain available while screens migrate incrementally onto primitives.

## Accessibility and resilience

The shell includes a keyboard skip link, semantic navigation/main landmarks, visible focus rings, reduced-motion behavior, route loading/error/not-found states and a global error boundary. Empty states are explicit and do not fall back to fabricated frontend data.

## Production gate

`make frontend-foundation-validate` rejects legacy unprotected route directories, direct page `fetch()` calls, hard-coded demo identities, browser references to Python/internal routes, production auth bypass, mock-only product copy, and missing foundation assets. CI additionally runs `pnpm build` and Playwright shell tests in a dependency-provisioned environment.
